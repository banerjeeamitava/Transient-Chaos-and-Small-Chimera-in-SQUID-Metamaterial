# Transient-Chaos-and-Small-Chimera-in-SQUID-Metamaterial

This is a code that simulates the flux dynamics of a set of coupled SQUID devices for different parameters, and infers the nature of the collective dynamical state obtained at different parameter values to generate data for a phase diagram.
